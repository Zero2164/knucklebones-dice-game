### 🎮 About Knucklebones

Knucklebones is a fast-paced competitive dice placement game played on two 3×3 grids. Players take turns rolling dice and placing them strategically to score points and sabotage their opponent. Key mechanics include:

✅ Matching dice: Placing multiple of the same number in a column multiplies the value.
✅ Knockout: Placing a die matching your opponent’s in the same column destroys their dice of that value.
✅ Race to fill the board: The first player to fill all nine slots ends the game; the player with the highest score wins.
