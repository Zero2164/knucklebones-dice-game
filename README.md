# 🎲 Knucklebones (Web Adaptation)

A web-based open-source adaptation of the "Knucklebones" minigame featured in the video game **Cult of the Lamb**, originally developed by Massive Monster and published by Devolver Digital.

This project recreates the gameplay experience of Knucklebones in a web browser, supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Players can face off in a turn-based dice game where strategic placement, multipliers, and knockouts determine the victor.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- Two players take turns rolling a die and placing it on their 3×3 board.
- Matching dice in the same column multiply their total value.
- Placing a die with the same number in the same column on your opponent’s board knocks out matching dice.
- The game ends when one board is full; the player with the highest score wins.
